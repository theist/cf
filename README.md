# cf - AI-Powered Command Finder

**This software is based in whole or in part on code generated by an artificial intelligence system.**

`cf` is a command-line tool that leverages the Gemini AI to help you find and understand Linux bash commands. You provide a natural language description of what you want to do, and `cf` fetches a suitable command, explains it, and then gives you options to run, edit, or simply print the command.

## Features

*   **AI-Generated Commands:** Get bash commands based on natural language prompts.
*   **Command Explanations:** Understand what the generated command does with an AI-provided explanation.
*   **Interactive Workflow:**
    *   **Run:** Execute the command directly (with caution!).
    *   **Edit:** Modify the command in your `$EDITOR` before execution.
    *   **Print:** Display the command for easy copying.
    *   **Cancel:** Exit without doing anything.
*   **Colorful UI:** Uses the `rich` library for a pleasant terminal experience.
*   **Configurable:** Set your Gemini API key, preferred model, and editor via environment variables.

## Requirements

*   Python 3.7+
*   The following Python libraries:
    *   `google-generativeai`
    *   `rich`
    *   `readchar`
*   A **Gemini API Key**.
*   An editor set in your `$EDITOR` environment variable (e.g., `vim`, `nano`). Defaults to `vim` if not set.

## Installation

1.  **Clone the repository or download the `cf.py` script.**

2.  **Install Python dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install google-generativeai rich readchar
    ```

3.  **Set up your Gemini API Key:**
    You need to set your Gemini API Key as an environment variable. Add the following line to your shell's configuration file (e.g., `~/.bashrc`, `~/.zshrc`):
    ```bash
    export GEMINI_API_KEY="YOUR_API_KEY_HERE"
    ```
    Replace `"YOUR_API_KEY_HERE"` with your actual API key. Remember to source your configuration file (e.g., `source ~/.bashrc`) or open a new terminal session for the changes to take effect.

4.  **Make the script executable (optional but recommended):**
    ```bash
    chmod +x cf
    ```

## Usage

Run `cf` followed by your prompt describing the command you need:

```bash
cf <your prompt>
```

**Example:**

```bash
cf "list all python files in my home directory modified in the last 24 hours"
cf "show disk usage for the current directory sorted by size"
cf "find processes using port 8080"
```

Once the command is generated and displayed, you will be presented with the following options:

*   **`<Enter>`:** Run the suggested command.
*   **`e`:** Edit the command in your `$EDITOR` before potentially running it.
*   **`p`:** Print the command to the console (useful for copying).
*   **`<Esc>`:** Cancel and exit the program.

## Configuration

`cf` can be configured using environment variables:

*   `GEMINI_API_KEY`: (Required) Your API key for accessing the Gemini API.
*   `EDITOR`: (Optional) The command to launch your preferred text editor (e.g., `vim`, `nano`, `code --wait`). Defaults to `vim`.
*   `CF_MODEL_NAME`: (Optional) The Gemini model to use. Defaults to `gemini-1.5-flash-latest` (as per the script, but your version uses `gemini-2.5-flash-preview-05-20`).


## ⚠️ Warning

**Always review AI-generated commands carefully before executing them.** Running commands, especially those with `sudo` or that modify files, can have unintended and potentially harmful consequences. The user is solely responsible for the execution of any command.
