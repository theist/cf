Responsible AI Software Engineering License (RAISE) - Version 1.0

Preamble

This license governs software that has been generated in whole or in part with
the assistance of artificial intelligence systems. Its purpose is to ensure
freedom to use, modify, and redistribute the software, while preserving
transparency about its origin and generation process.

1. Grant of Rights

Subject to the terms of this license, you are granted a worldwide,
royalty-free, non-exclusive, perpetual right to:

- Use the software for any purpose;
- Study and modify the software;
- Copy and distribute the software, in original or modified form;
- Sub-license the software under the terms of this license.

2. Conditions of Redistribution and Modification

Any redistribution or derivative work of this software must comply with the
following conditions:

2.1 Acknowledgment of AI Involvement

Any redistributed or modified version of the software must include, in a clear
and prominent place (e.g., at the beginning of each main source file or in an
accompanying NOTICE file or in the README file), the following statement:

  “This software is based in whole or in part on code generated by an artificial intelligence system.”

You may optionally include the identity or pseudonym of the individual who
initiated the generation (i.e., the creator of the original prompt), and the
date of initial generation.

2.2 Prompt Disclosure

Any redistributed or modified version of the software must include, in a
readable text file (e.g., PROMPT.txt, PROMPTS.md, or similar), the prompts or
instructions that were used to generate the original version of the software.
This includes any textual inputs or contextual information provided to the AI
system that significantly influenced the resulting code.

2.3 Prompt Derivatives

Prompts and input instructions disclosed under this license are considered part
of the source material. Any substantial reuse, adaptation, or transformation of
these prompts for the purpose of generating new software with an AI system
shall be treated as a derivative work.

Such derivative use must:
- Include the derived or adapted prompts;
- Acknowledge that the software was generated in whole or in part using
  prompts subject to this license;
- Comply with the same disclosure, attribution and derivative conditions as set
  out in Section 2.

3. Disclaimer of Warranty and Liability

The software is provided “as is”, without warranty of any kind, express or
implied, including but not limited to warranties of merchantability, fitness
for a particular purpose, and non-infringement.

In no event shall the original prompt creator, any contributor, or the
artificial intelligence system itself be held liable for any claim, damages,
or other liability, whether in an action of contract, tort, or otherwise,
arising from or related to the use of the software.

4. Termination

Any violation of the terms of this license will automatically terminate the
rights granted herein. Upon termination, you must cease all use, distribution,
and modification of the software, unless otherwise permitted under a separate
license.

5. No Endorsement

Nothing in this license shall be construed as an endorsement of the software,
its output, or its use, by the original prompt creator, contributors, or the
developers of the AI system.

Photons Be Free.
