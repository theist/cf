I need a python program that will ask gemini for a linux comand and then will
ask the user if the result generated can be evaled (fired in console thru
eval). 

The way to use the progam will be cf <prompt>; the prompt will be 
injected to be sure gemini returns only linux command compatible with bash
preferibly an oneliner with a limit of four lines, whitout quotes or comments
or things that prevent the commands to work, the command will show the comands
and an explanation of the command generated by another call to gemini. 

Once the command is presented the user can <esc> to cancel, <enter> to run, 
'e' for edit the command in $EDITOR before eval or p to just echo the commands.
With colors and nice ui.

Prompted by @theist to gemini 2.5 flash preview on 2025/05/29
